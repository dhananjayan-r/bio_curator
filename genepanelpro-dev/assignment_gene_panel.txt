I. Gene-panels based report:
	-> Input:
		-> Drop down to list the gene-panels. User can select one or more gene-panels

	-> lookup:
		-> Take panel_name for gene-panel-names
		-> Take unique genes in primary_gene, and secondary_gene for genes

	-> Output:
		-> Table to list the unique genes in each selected gene-panel (Table: Sno, gene-panel, genes)
		-> plot venn diagram
		-> By clicking any gene, pop-up gene-info & SVG of the chromosome & mark the gene's location in the chromosome (use gene-info API to fetch the data for the pop-up). Refer: https://genepanel.iobio.io/


II. Gene based report:
	-> Input:
		-> one or more genes as text

	-> lookup:
		-> Take panel_name for gene-panel-names
		-> Take unique genes in primary_gene, and secondary_gene for genes

	-> Output:
		-> Table to list the gene-panel & hit genes (Table: Sno, gene-panel, genes)
		-> plot venn diagram
		-> By clicking any gene, pop-up gene-info & SVG of the chromosome & mark the gene's location in the chromosome (use gene-info API to fetch the data for the pop-up). Refer: https://genepanel.iobio.io/



-> What to do?
1. Prepare the google document with following details & share to the team.
	- title of the assignment
	- team members
	- overview
	- requirements
	- high level design (HLD)
	- low level design (LLD)

2. Explain the document to the team (including Vivek, Ameen, Vadivu, and Ravi). After confirmation, start developing the application.

3. Do all tests (prepare test-cases)

4. Final demo
